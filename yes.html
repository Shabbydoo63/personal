            For: Juliana
            <div class="hidden-text"><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   This may not be the first instance that I've fallen in love, but I've surely not felt this sure with anyone else before.
                I love you so much, my pretty valentine. The universe may have tested us from time to time, but I'm glad that I'm still here making this letter/website for you hahahaha.
                May all the dreams that we have for each other come to fruition when the time is right. When the time is right, I hope that it'll be you standing by my side.<br>

                I love you, baby. More than you'll ever know ❤️. <br><br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp-&nbsp&nbsp
                Your chubby boy:)) <br><br><br><a href="index.html"><button>home</button></a>
